# Light Bedrock Status

This is forked from rdnsx/Bedrock-Status with the purpose to pull the API using only HTML and JavaScript instead of Python to allow the page to be ran on GitHub Pages without the need for a Docker Container. At the moment, the page is static and set to my server only, but once you remove the Home Coordinates and the API page from my server to your own, it works flawlessly.
